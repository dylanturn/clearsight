- What is the purpose of this code
- How does it work step-by-step
- How does this code integrate with the rest of the codebase
- Does this code duplicate functionality present elsewhere
- Are there any potential issues or limitations with this approach?

Other Notes:
- When running python commands, use the virtual environment at `./venv`

**IMPORTANT**: When making changes to the codebase, review REGRESSIONS.md to ensure that the change does not break any existing functionality.

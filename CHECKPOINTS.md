## Checkpoint 3 - Telemetry System Optimization
*Date: 2024-12-06*

### Changes Made
1. **WebSocket Implementation**
   - Switched from HTTP POST to WebSocket for telemetry data transmission
   - Added error handling and reconnection logic for WebSocket connections
   - Implemented rate limiting for mouse movement events

2. **Event-Driven Telemetry**
   - Modified telemetry script to use event-driven updates
   - Added intelligent event filtering and rate limiting
   - Prevented telemetry capture during session replay

3. **Database Management**
   - Created `clear_telemetry` management command for database maintenance
   - Added options for dry runs and date-based filtering
   - Successfully cleaned legacy data (34 sessions, 30,410 events)

4. **Infinite Loop Prevention**
   - Updated fetch and XHR interceptors to ignore telemetry requests
   - Modified base template to conditionally load telemetry script
   - Added `disable_telemetry` flag to session replay view

### Code Improvements
- Enhanced code organization in telemetry.js
- Added proper static file loading with {% load static %}
- Improved error handling and logging
- Updated CSP headers for better security

### Next Steps
1. Monitor WebSocket performance and reliability
2. Implement session data pagination and filtering
3. Add telemetry data visualization features
4. Consider adding telemetry data compression

## Checkpoint 2 - WebSocket and Sessions List Implementation
*Date: 2024-12-05*

### Changes Made
1. **WebSocket Connection Improvements**
   - Updated ASGI configuration with proper WebSocket routing and middleware
   - Added Daphne as the ASGI server for better WebSocket support
   - Configured channel layers properly
   - Fixed WebSocket URL pattern and construction in telemetry.js
   - Added proper error handling and reconnection logic

2. **Sessions Management**
   - Created new sessions list view (`sessions_list`) to display all recorded sessions
   - Implemented sessions list template with Tailwind CSS styling
   - Added URL pattern for accessing the sessions list at `/sessions/`
   - Enhanced session display with:
     - Clickable session IDs
     - Start time information
     - Active/Inactive status indicators
     - Event count per session

### Dependencies Added
- Daphne 4.0.0 (ASGI server)

### Configuration Updates
- Updated `clearsight/asgi.py` with proper WebSocket routing
- Enhanced `clearsight/settings.py` with Channels configuration
- Added WebSocket-specific settings for development

### Next Steps
1. Test WebSocket reliability with extended usage
2. Add pagination to sessions list for better performance with large datasets
3. Implement session filtering and search functionality
4. Add more detailed session statistics and visualizations
